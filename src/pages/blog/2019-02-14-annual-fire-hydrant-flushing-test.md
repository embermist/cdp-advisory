It is advised that No Washing of Clothes or other water sensitive operations be performed until the water clears completely.  Additionally, it is also recommended that you limit or avoid using hot water and allow a cold water faucet to run a few minutes before using.  Please be assured this work will be done in a professional manner with as little inconvenience as possible to the customers of WMU.
