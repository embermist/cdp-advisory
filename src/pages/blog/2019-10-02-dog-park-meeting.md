A meeting is scheduled in Wildcat Park near the playground on Thursday, July 2 @ 6:00 pm. to gather public comments whether supportive or not.  The City Park & Recreation will be leading this public meeting to learn the level of support of the community.  Those in support, will be encouraged to participate with questions, such as location, size, design ideas, funding, etc.  Light refreshments will be served and we hope to have a good turn-out.
