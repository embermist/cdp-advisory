Mr. Neuman graduated from Harvard Law School and later became passionate in planning and zoning law.  He taught as a permanent member of the faculty at the law schools of Washington University in St. Louis and the universities of Kentucky, Louisville, Ohio State, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Mr. Neuman has a wife, Mary, of 30 years and they have three children.  We are very excited to have Mr. Neuman heading up our Planning & Zoning Department.  He will be an important mentor to all of the staff.
