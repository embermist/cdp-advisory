HYDRANT FLUSHING NOTICE

This is only a demo. If this were a real advisory you would see a whole lot more information...

Please be advised. We will be flushing fire hydrants in the Roberts Road area on Friday. You may notice reduced pressure or a slight discoloration in the water. This is normal for this maintenance procedure. The water is safe to drink.
