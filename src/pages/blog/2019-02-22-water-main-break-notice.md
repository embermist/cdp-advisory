description: Water Main Break on April Way
---
Please be advised a water main break has been confirmed at the intersection of April Way and Dubuy Drive.  Repairs are **IN PROGRESS**.  Customers in the immediate vicinity of the work may experience low water pressure and temporary discoloration of their water caused by sedimentation being broken loose from the water lines.  This discoloration does not affect the safety of the water and should be clear within 2-3 hours of the work being completed.  

It is advised that No Washing of Clothes or other water sensitive operations be performed until the water clears completely.  Additionally, it is also recommended that you limit or avoid using hot water and allow a cold water faucet to run a few minutes before using.  

We appreciate your cooperation and apologize for any inconvenience this work may cause.
