"DO NOT BURN LEAVES" - Many counties across Kentucky are currently in a Level Two drought and have implemented a Burning Ban according to the State of Kentucky Emergency Management office.  A Level Two drought has been declared for areas in central and eastern Kentucky and parts of western Kentucky and could result in substantial agricultural loss, low stream flows, increases in wildfires and could ultimately impact the water utilities ability to provide clean drinking water.
